# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	**version control helps track each iteration of a file in a database or repository. It is useful in that if a mistake is made, a developer can open a previous version of the file**

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	**A branch is a new iteration of a file created off of the original that can be edited independently of the original. You can do this to add new features to the file while keeping the original intact, incase something goes wrong.**

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	**A commit is when a change is made to a file and given a unique random ID number so we can track these changes. A good commit message is a brief description of what the developer changed in the file.**

* What is a merge conflict?
	**A merge conflict is when we bring another branch into our current working branch. If we have new files in a current branch, but try to merge it into another branch while does not contain those files, a conflict will occur.**

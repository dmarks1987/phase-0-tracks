<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
-Semantic tags are used to make HTML documents easier to read. Technically, they are all pretty much divs, but by giving them different names it makes the code easier to read. They are all pretty useful. Sections and divs are really common as far as I can see. Asides are great too.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
-HTML pages are loaded from top to bottom. First element will load first, last element will load last.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
-I will probably wind up creating snippets as I start to see more common patterns in HTML. I'm a big fan of hot-keys in video games, so I can see myself embracing this technology fully. I think the most difficult thing to wrap my head around is learning about when precisely to use certain semantic elements. I'm starting to get the hang of it, but I feel like it's something I will become much more fluent in as I create more pages.

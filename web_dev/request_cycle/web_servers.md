# WEB SERVERS
* Web servers can exist as big physical machines or as pieces of remote memory created by the developer.

### Linux
* It's a unix based operating system that was designed under an open-source philosophy. It was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. It's the leading operating system on servers and general purpose operating systems due to the Android platform on smartphones.
* Its source code may be used, modified and distributed by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses.
* One of its key strengths is interoperablity which means its systems work with other products or systems without any restrictions.
* Linux is used by very reliable internet hosting companies for web servers.
* It's the dominate architecture for smartphones (79.3% of all devices due to Android), tablet computers, smart TVs, and in-vehicle infotainment systems. It's also used by Android, Firefox OS, Mer and Tizen.

### VPS - Virtual Private Server
* Essentially, a VPS is a hosting environment that acts like an actual server, but is really on a shared hosting environment. One of the advantages of a VPS is that you can rent the space for less and you don't have to manage the server directly. People making websites just need to upload their files to the server.
* Another advantage is you can run virtualized operating systems.
* Other advantages include privacy as there are no other websites on the server that potentially have access to your files, having your own OS, it can be restarted without affecting anyone else you might be sharing space with, and you have dedicated resources like RAM that is available at any time.

### Disadvantages of Being a Root User on Linux
* From my research, it is apparent that being a root user is dangerous because once something is done, it is done forever. It is like a "god mode" per se. Root users have access to everything and can do everything. Normal users can't install software or change the system critical settings. It's safer to switch to a normal user, just incase any mistakes are made. It is similar to being an administrator on Windows.
